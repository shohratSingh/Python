# Before handling any files get the accessibility of a File
#In python open() function is used to get the acessibility of a file
#In python close() is used to close the file

WE CAN GET THE ACCESSIBILITY IN TWO WAYS:
--> without context manager(not using keyword with)
--> with context manager(using with keyword)

-->without context manager:
    if we open a file without context manager explicitly we have to
    close the file using close function else the data will be destroyed
SYNTAX:
    variable = open('file_path/filename','mode')
    variable.close()

--> with context manager:
    if we open a file using with context manager no need
    to close the file explicitly 
SYNTAX:
    with open('file_name/file_path','mode') as ALIAS:
        -----Statement Block--------

MODE:
#It defines based on what requirement we are going to take the 
accessibility

mode:
    1.write --> w
    http://2.read --> r
    3.append --> a
    4.create --> x
#Bt default it opens in the file in read mode

1.write mode(w):
    *It is used to create the data into the file
    *In this case is the file is not existing then control will create a new file data will be written
    *If the file is already exist then control will overwrite the data by the new data

TO CREATE THE DATA WE HAVE TO USE
    1.write()
    2.writelines()

1.write():
    *By using write function it is possible to write a single line of data to the file
    *It accepts string
SYNTAX:
    variable/alias_name.write('new_data'/variable)


2.writelines():
    *By using this function it is possible to write multiple lines of data in the form of list

SYNTAX:
    varible/alias_name.writelines(['line1','line2','line3'......'line n'])
